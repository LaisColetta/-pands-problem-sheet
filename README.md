### Week02: bmi
In this first task we were asked to write a program that calculates somebody's Body Mass Index (BMI). The references I used were: 
  * javatpoint.com; 
  * w3resource - in this website I learned an introductions of variables and how to make calculations using python. As I have no background related to IT, in this first week; 
  * I watched many tutorials on YouTube to learn the concepts mentioned in the lecture. Some of the tutorials were from Realpython.com and this python course for beginners: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKHEtdqhLK8&t=1833s&ab_channel=BroCode.

### Week03: secondString
In this lecture, we learned about variable types,lists introduction and random generator module, how to round an intenger, measure the lenght of a string and some formatting tips. On week's 03 task, we wrote a program that asks a user to input a string and outputs every second letter in reverse order. In this task we learned concepts of slicing and reversing an input. 
The references I used were: 
  * https://realpython.com/reverse-string-python/; 
  * www.w3schools.com; 
  * https://codippa.com/how-to-print-characters-at-even-position-in-string-in-python/;
  * https://stackoverflow.com/ discussion forum. 
 

### Week04: collatz
Week 04 we learned about While and For loops and If, Elif and else statements. The complementary material I used were: 
  * https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/; 
  * https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/while-loop video tutorial; 
  * Python| While Loop and If-Else together - Youtube tutorial and the articles https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp, https://realpython.com/lessons/while-loops/.
  
 In week 04 we wrote a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation.

### Week05: weekday
The topics discussed in week 05 were lists, tuple, dictionaries, more of For and While loops and an overview of Jupyter notebooks. The weekly task was to write a program that checks if today is a weekday/weekend day and returns a message to the user. In this task we had to import the datetime module and my main sources were:
  * https://www.tutorialsrack.com/articles/324; 
  * YouTube video: Datetime Module (Dates and Times) || Python Tutorial || Learn Python Programming;
  * the article https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-check-whether-the-day-is-a-weekday-or-not-using-pandas-in-python/.

### Week06: squareRoot
We learned about functions in week 06, which fits into the strutured programming such as while loops. Global variables and why we should avoid them was also a subject in the course that week. We wrote a program as our weekly tasks that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root. We used the Newton's method to estimating square roots results. My references were:
  * https://web.archive.org/web/20100330183043/http://nlindblad.org/2007/04/04/write-your-own-square-root-function article
  * the video 'Approximating Square Roots w/ Newton's Method' - YouTube;
  * https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/48725/approximating-the-square-root-using-an-iterative-method/48904#48904;
  * https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1623375/writing-your-own-square-root-function forum discussion. 

### Week07: es
How to open, write and read a file using function was the main subject of the week 07. We then wrote a program that reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's the file contains. The references used to this task were the websites: 
  * www.geeksforgeeks.org; 
  * https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open; 
  * https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/basic/python-basic-1-exercise-7.php.

### Week08: plotTask
On week 08 we had an introduction of numpy and learned about matplotlib, which is a plotting library to create different types of data visualization in Python. The references used were References: 
  * https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-plotting-in-python-set-1/; 
  * https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/customizing.html;
  * YouTube video 'Watch this if you want to LEARN MATPLOTLIB for PYTHON!'.

### Github Issue
In the first lectures, I had difficulties in adding the projects into Github and, while I thought I was using the correct repository, I was actually adding my projects into a different one. For that reason, the dates that I pushed my first projects to the repository -pands-problem-sheet- were newer than the dates that I actually started my projects. I have sent Andrew an email explaining the trouble I was facing on the 27/02/2022 and also another email on the 02/02/2022 saying that I could only start the course on the second week of february. I hope you can take this into consideration for the consistency grades for this project.
