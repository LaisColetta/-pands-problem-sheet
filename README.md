### Week02 bmi.py
In this task we were asked to write a program that calculates somebody's Body Mass Index (BMI). The references I used were javatpoint.com and w3resource website, where I could learn an introductions of variables and how to make calculations using python. As I have no background related to IT, in this first week I watched many tutorials on YouTube to learn the concepts mentioned in the lecture. Some of the tutorials were from Realpython.com and this python course for beginners: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKHEtdqhLK8&t=1833s&ab_channel=BroCode

### Week03 secondString.py
On week 03 we wrote a program that asks a user to input a string and outputs every second letter in reverse order. In this task we learned concepts of slicing and reversing an input. The references I used were https://realpython.com/reverse-string-python/, www.w3schools.com, https://codippa.com/how-to-print-characters-at-even-position-in-string-in-python/ and https://stackoverflow.com/ discussion forum. In week 03 we also learned about variable types,lists introduction and random generator module, how to round an intenger, measure the lenght of a string and some formatting tips.

### Week04 collatz.py
Week 04 we learned about While and For loops and If, Elif and else statements. The complementary material I used were https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/, https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/while-loop video tutorial, Python| While Loop and If-Else together - Youtube tutorial and the articles https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp, https://realpython.com/lessons/while-loops/. In week 04 we wrote a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation.

### Week05-weekday.py
The topics discussed in week 05 were lists, tuple, dictionaries and more of For and While loops. We also had an overview of Jupyter notebooks. The weekly task was to write a program that checks if today is a weekday/weekend day and returns a message to the user. In this task we had to import the datetime module and my main sources were https://www.tutorialsrack.com/articles/324 , YouTube video: Datetime Module (Dates and Times) || Python Tutorial || Learn Python Programming and the article https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-check-whether-the-day-is-a-weekday-or-not-using-pandas-in-python/.

### Week06-squareRoot.py
We learned about functions in week 06, which fits into the strutured programming such as while loops. Global variables and why we should avoid them was also a subject in the course that week. We wrote a program as our weekly tasks that takes a positive floating-point number as input and outputs an approximation of its square root. We used the Newton's method to estimating square roots results. My references were https://web.archive.org/web/20100330183043/http://nlindblad.org/2007/04/04/write-your-own-square-root-function article, the video 'Approximating Square Roots w/ Newton's Method' - YouTube, https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/48725/approximating-the-square-root-using-an-iterative-method/48904#48904 and https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1623375/writing-your-own-square-root-function forum discussion. 

### Week07-es.py
How to open, write and read a file using function was the main subject of the week 07. We then wrote a program that reads in a text file and outputs the number of e's the file contains. The references used to this task were the websites www.geeksforgeeks.org, https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#open, https://www.w3resource.com/python-exercises/basic/python-basic-1-exercise-7.php.

### Week08-plotTask.py
On week 08 we had an introduction of numpy and lerned about matplotlib which is a plotting library to create different types of data visualization in Python. The references used were References: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/graph-plotting-in-python-set-1/, https://matplotlib.org/stable/tutorials/introductory/customizing.html and the YouTube video 'Watch this if you want to LEARN MATPLOTLIB for PYTHON!'

### Github Issue
In the beginning of the course, I had difficulties in adding the projects to Github and, while I thought I was using the correct repository, I was actually adding my projects into a different one. For that reason, the dates that I pushed my project to the repository -pands-problem-sheet- is newer than the date that I have started my projects. I have sent you an email explaining this situation on the 27/02/2022 and also another email on the 02/02/2022 saying that I could only start the course on the second week of february. I hope you can take this into consideration for the consistency grades for this project.
