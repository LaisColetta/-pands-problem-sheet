### Week02-bmi.py
In this task we were asked to write a program that calculates somebody's Body Mass Index (BMI). The references I used were javatpoint.com and w3resource website, where I could learn an introductions of variables and how to make calculations using python. As I have no background related to IT, in this first week I watched many tutorials on YouTube to learn the concepts mentioned in the lecture. Some of the tutorials were from Realpython.com and this python course for beginners: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKHEtdqhLK8&t=1833s&ab_channel=BroCode

### Week03-secondstring.py
In week 03 we wrote a program that asks a user to input a string and outputs every second letter in reverse order. In this task we learned concepts of slicing and reversing an input. The references I used the most were https://realpython.com/reverse-string-python/, www.w3schools.com and https://stackoverflow.com/ discussion forum. In week 03 we also learned about variable types,lists introduction and random generator module, how to round a intenger, measure the lenght of a string and some formatting tips.

### Week04-collatz.py
Week 04 we learned about While and For loops and If, Elif and else statements. The complementary material I used were https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/, https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/while-loop video tutorial, Python| While Loop and If-Else together - Youtube tutorial and the articles https://www.w3schools.com/python/python_while_loops.asp, https://realpython.com/lessons/while-loops/. In week 04 we were wrote a program that asks the user to input any positive integer and outputs the successive values of the following calculation.

### Week05-weekday.py
The topics discussed in week 05 were lists, tuple, dictionaries, more of For and While loops. The weekly task were to write a program that checks if today is a weekday/weekend day and returns a message to the user. In this task we had to import the datetime module and my main sources were https://www.tutorialsrack.com/articles/324 , YouTube video: Datetime Module (Dates and Times) || Python Tutorial || Learn Python Programming and the article https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-check-whether-the-day-is-a-weekday-or-not-using-pandas-in-python/.

### Week06-squareroot.py
We learned about and a task of making a interactive menu where we can add content to a list to be displayed later.
